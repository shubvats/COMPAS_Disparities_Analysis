Unveiling Disparities in COMPAS Algorithm: A Comprehensive
Analysis of Predictive Accuracy, Bias, and Future Directions

Abstract
This research delves into a meticulous examination of the COMPAS algorithm, a widely utilized
tool in criminal justice for predicting recidivism risk. The report comprises three interwoven
parts, each contributing to a holistic understanding of the algorithm's functionality and
implications. In the initial section, "Background, Models, Methodology, and Theory," the study
unfolds the historical context and controversies surrounding COMPAS, deploying logistic
regression and survival analysis models to elucidate the statistical underpinnings.
Methodological intricacies are unraveled, providing a transparent view of the algorithm's
implementation.
The second segment, "Empirical Studies," is a deep dive into simulation analyses focused on
disparities in decile scores concerning race, gender, and age. Through meticulous data
preprocessing, descriptive statistics, and correlation analyses, the study unveils the nuanced
relationships within the dataset. Logistic regression results, violent offense analyses, and
survival analyses are presented with detailed interpretations and visual representations,
enriching the empirical exploration.
The third part, "Discussion," synthesizes major findings, critiques the proposed methods, and
outlines future research directions. Logistic regression insights into demographic biases,
survival analysis findings on temporal dynamics, and unique revelations from violent offense
analyses are critically examined. The report concludes with a call for algorithmic fairness,
contextual information integration, and collaboration with domain experts in future research.
This research serves not only as a comprehensive analysis of COMPAS but as a foundation for
ongoing discourse on improving the fairness and accuracy of predictive algorithms in criminal
justice.

Background:
The analysis is conducted on a dataset related to the COMPAS (Correctional Offender
Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) system, focusing on predicting recidivism and
assessing potential biases in the criminal justice system. The dataset includes various features
such as age, race, gender, criminal history, and COMPAS scores.
Statistical Models and Problems:
The primary statistical problem addressed is the prediction of recidivism, which is whether an
individual will reoffend within two years. Two types of datasets are analyzed: one considering
general recidivism and another focusing on violent recidivism. The main statistical models used
include logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.

Logistic Regression:
 Model:
score_factor∼gender_factor+age_factor+race_factor+priors_count+crime_facto
r+two_year_recidscore_factor∼gender_factor+age_factor+race_factor+priors_c
ount+crime_factor+two_year_recid
 Description: Logistic regression is utilized to predict the likelihood of high
COMPAS scores based on various predictor variables.
 Algorithm: Maximum likelihood estimation is employed to estimate the
coefficients.
Cox Proportional Hazards Model:
 Model:
Surv(start, end, event, type = "counting")∼score_factor+race_factor+score_facto
r×race_factorSurv(start, end, event, type = "counting")∼score_factor+race_facto
r+score_factor×race_factor
 Description: Cox proportional hazards model is applied to study the time until
recidivism, considering both the score factor and race factor.
 Algorithm: Partial likelihood estimation is used to estimate hazard ratios.
Methodology:
Data Preprocessing:
 Filtering the dataset to remove irrelevant entries.
 Transforming categorical variables into factors.
 Calculating the length of stay in jail.
Descriptive Statistics:
 Calculating summary statistics for key variables (e.g., age, race, score text).
Bias Assessment:
 Investigating potential biases in the COMPAS scores based on race, gender, and
other factors.
Logistic Regression:
 Fitting logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of high COMPAS
scores.
Survival Analysis:
 Applying Cox proportional hazards models to study survival probabilities
considering recidivism.
Theory:
The analysis builds upon existing literature that highlights concerns about fairness and bias in
the criminal justice system, particularly in predictive algorithms. Previous studies have
discussed challenges related to the disparate impact of these algorithms on different
demographic groups.
Empirical Studies:
Analysis
The COMPAS scores for "Risk of Violent Recidivism" and "Risk of Recidivism" were examined.
The COMPAS score for "Risk of Failure to Appear" was not examined by us.
We started by examining the recidivism risk score. The basic distribution of the COMPAS decile
scores between whites and blacks was the focus of our initial investigation. For 6,172 prisoners
who had not been arrested for a new offense or who had recidivated within the previous two
years, we plotted the distribution of these scores.
Figure 1 Bar Graph Depicting Black and White Defendant’s Decile Scores
These histograms demonstrate how black defendants' scores were similarly distributed
throughout, but white defendants' scores were biased toward lower-risk groups. There were
1,175 female defendants and 4,997 male defendants in our two-year sample, comprising 3,175
black defendants and 2,103 white defendants. In this sample, 2,809 defendants experienced
recidivism during a two-year period.
CompAS's violent risk score histograms also reveal a discrepancy in the distribution of scores
between defendants who are white and those who are black. The sample size that we utilized
to assess COMPAS's violent recidivism score was 4,020 defendants, 1,918 black defendants, and
1,459 white defendants; this sample size was slightly smaller than that of the general recidivism
score. 652 violent recidivists were identified.
Figure 2 Bar Graph Depicting Black and White Defendant’s Violent Decile Scores
While there is a clear difference between the distributions of COMPAS scores for white and
black defendants, merely looking at the distributions does not account for other demographic
and behavioral factors.
To test racial disparities in the score controlling for other factors, we created a logistic
regression model that considered race, age, criminal history, future recidivism, charge degree,
gender and age.
Figure 3 Table Depicting Logistic Regression Model for General Recidivism
To model the likelihood of receiving a higher COMPAS score, we considered those factors. We
regarded scores greater than "low" to indicate a risk of recidivism since according to COMPAS,
"scores in the medium and high range garner more interest from supervision agencies than low
scores, as a low score would suggest there is little risk of general recidivism.
According to our logistic model, age was the most reliable indicator of a higher risk score. Even
after accounting for past criminal history, potential for future crime, gender, and race,
defendants under 25 had a 2.5-fold increased chance of receiving a higher score than middle-
aged offenders.
Additionally, race was a strong predictor of higher scores. Black defendants were 45 percent
more likely than White defendants to receive a higher score after accounting for other criteria
including their higher overall recidivism rates.
Remarkably, after adjusting for the same variables, female offenders were 19.4% more likely
than male defendants to receive a better score, despite their lower overall levels of criminality.
Figure 4 Table Depicting Logistic Regression Model for Violent Recidivism
Additionally, there is a risk of violent recidivism score in the COMPAS software. We examined
4,020 individuals who had their violent recidivism scores calculated during a two-year period
(excluding time spent in jail or prison). For these scores, we used a similar regression model.
An even greater predictor of a higher violent recidivism score was age. After adjusting for past
criminal history, gender, race, and future violent recidivism, our regression analysis revealed
that youthful defendants had a 6.4-fold higher chance of receiving a higher score than middle-
aged defendants.
Additionally, a higher score for violent recidivism was predicted by race. After accounting for
past criminal histories and potential violent recidivism, black defendants had a 77.3 percent
higher chance of receiving a higher score than white defendants.
We used the data to design a Cox proportional hazards model in order to assess the overall
prediction accuracy of COMPAS. We can compare recidivism rates while adjusting for time
using a Cox model. Because we aren’t controlling for other factors such as a defendant’s
criminality, we can include more people in this Cox model. 10,314 defendants (3,569 white
defendants and 5,147 black defendants) made up our sample size for this analysis.
Figure 5 Table depicting Cox Model for General Recidivism
People in our data set were deemed to be "at risk" on the day they received their COMPAS
score, April 1, 2016, or until they committed a new violation, whichever happened first. We
took them off the danger that was placed on them while they were in prison. The COMPAS
categorical risk score served as the independent variable in the Cox model.
According to the Cox model, the likelihood of recidivating was shown to be 3.5 times higher for
those with high scores than for those with low scores (scores 1 to 4). According to a research,
those who scored highly (scores 8 to 10) had a 5.6-fold increased risk of recidivating. The
predictive value of the score is indicated by both findings.
A survival plot also shows a clear difference in recidivism rates between each COMPAS score
level.
Figure 6 Survival Plot for difference in recidivism rates between different COMPAS score level
The concordance score of the Cox regression was 63.6 percent overall. This indicates that 63.6
percent of the time, the COMPAS algorithm can correctly assess the recidivism risk of any
randomly chosen pair of defendants in the sample (for example, if one of the pair recidivates,
the pair will be considered successful if the other member of the pair also had a better score).
Using the underlying risk scores, which are ranked from 1 to 10, instead of the low, middle, and
high ranges when running the Cox model produced a slightly higher concordance of 66.4
percent.
The concordance of the COMPAS violent recidivism score was 65.1%.
The COMPAS methodology predicts recidivism differently for men and women. Based on
approximations, women who were classified as high risk experienced a 47.5% recidivism rate in
the two years after their assessment. However, throughout the same period, men who were
classified as high risk divorced at a significantly higher incidence of 61.2 percent. Law
enforcement officers reading the score may fail to see that a high-risk woman has a significantly
lower chance of recidivating than a high-risk man.

In our research, the COMPAS recidivism score's predictive accuracy for defendants of different
races was found to be similar: 62.5 percent for white defendants and 62.3 percent for black
defendants.
Across every risk category, black defendants recidivated at higher rates.

Figure 9 Table depicting General Recidivism Cox Model
To the Cox model, we additionally included a race-by-score interaction variable. This period
gave us the opportunity to investigate whether there were differences in recidivism between
defendants who scored highly and those who scored poorly for Black and White defendants.
Black defendants' high scores have a coefficient that is nearly statistically significant (0.0574).
Whereas high-risk black defendants are only 2.99 times more likely to recidivate than low-risk
black defendants, high-risk white defendants are 3.61 times more likely to do so. There are
racial differences in the hazard ratios for medium-risk versus low-risk defendants: 1.95 for black
defendants and 2.32 for white defendants. We can infer that the score is performing differently
across ethnic categories based on the difference in hazard ratios.
We examined COMPAS's violent recidivism score in a similar manner, but the results were not
comparable. The interaction term between race and score in this case was not significant,
indicating that there is no discernible difference between the risks associated with high- and
low-risk Black defendants and high- and low-risk White defendants.
Overall, violent recidivists make up a far smaller percentage of recidivists than general
recidivists, and the risk rates for black and white recidivists are similar across all score levels.

Summary of Major Findings:
The analysis of COMPAS scores for recidivism and violent recidivism indicates significant
disparities in score distribution between white and black defendants. Logistic regression models
reveal age and race as strong predictors, with younger and black defendants more likely to
receive higher scores. The Cox Proportional Hazards Model demonstrates that high COMPAS
scores correlate with a 3.5 times higher likelihood of recidivism. However, the concordance
score of 63.6% falls below the industry's reliability threshold. Gender disparities show that high-
risk men recidivate more than high-risk women. While black defendants recidivate at higher
rates, the COMPAS predictive accuracy remains consistent between white and black
defendants. The race-by-score interaction term suggests differential performance among racial
subgroups.
Criticism and Limitations:
Limitations include the study's acknowledgment that score distributions may not fully account
for demographic and behavioral factors. Despite predictive value, the concordance scores are
below industry standards. The study identifies disparities in how the COMPAS system predicts
recidivism across racial and gender subgroups, raising concerns about law enforcement's
interpretation. The report underscores variations in the performance of the COMPAS system
among racial subgroups, challenging its uniform effectiveness.
